This is my first code in Scala language!

A implementation of FizzBuzz in Scala Language.

'''

### Example:

>Input: 1, 2, 3, 5, 15, 30, 99 
>Result: 1, 2, Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz, FizzBuzz, Fizz


It uses Spec2 scala BDD library. You might need Apache Ivy to download its dependecies(If you use Eclipse I recommend IvyDE plugin).
